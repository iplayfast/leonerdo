A computer-vision program that outputs drawings for [Makelangelo](http://www.makelangelo.com/).

This is intended as an interactive art installation.
The drawings could be of persons who walk-up, rather than a pre-chosen image.

OpenCV is used to simplify the image into something that can be drawn,
and recognizable with a minimal number of lines.
